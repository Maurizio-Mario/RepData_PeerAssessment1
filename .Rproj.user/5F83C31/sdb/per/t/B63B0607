Loading and preprocessing the data\n\n### 1.1. Unzip and read the data  from the GitHub repository. Dimensional exploration.\n\n```{r}\nactivity <- read.csv(unz(\"activity.zip\", \"activity.csv\"))\nsapply(activity, class)\n```\n\n### 1.2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis.\n\nactivity$date is converted from factor to date class. I used the \"zoo\" package to manage the time serie which, furthermore, is regularly spaced. The data are collected on 61 days.\n\n``` {r, results = \"hide\"}\n\nactivity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\nsuppressWarnings(library(zoo))\nis.regular(activity$date)\nunique(activity$date)\n```\n\n\n## 2. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?\n\n### 2.1 Calculate the total number of steps taken per day\n\nThe result is calculated and stored in the object \"steps_day\". Missing values are removed. Since the resulting table is quinte large, I set {r, results = \"hide\"}. Approximately the 13% of cases in \"steps\" result in missing data.\n\n```{r, results = 'hide'}\ncolMeans(is.na(activity))\nsteps_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, rm.na = TRUE, data = activity, FUN = sum)\n```\n\n### 2.2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\nMissing gvalues are not omitted in this plot.\n\n```{r}\nplot(steps_day, type = \"h\", lwd = 10, lend = \"square\")\n```\n\n### 2.3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.\n\nSince those calculations return two large tables the results are not shown.\n\n\n```{r, results=\"hide\"}\naggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = mean)\naggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = median)\n```\n\n## 3. What is the average daily activity pattern?\n\n### 3.1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = \"l\") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)\n\n``` {r}\nplot(aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean), type = \"l\")\n```\n\n### 3.2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?\n\nThe base function max() should rapidly give us the answer.\n\n``` {r}\nmax(activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n",
