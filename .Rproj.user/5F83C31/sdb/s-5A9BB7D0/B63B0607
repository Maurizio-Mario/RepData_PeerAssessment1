Loading and preprocessing the data\n\n- Unzip and read the data  from the GitHub repository. Dimensional exploration.\n\n```{r}\nactivity <- read.csv(unz(\"activity.zip\", \"activity.csv\"))\nView(activity)\ndim(activity)\nnames(activity)\nsapply(activity, class)\n\n# PErcentage of NAs per column\n\ncolMeans(is.na(activity))\n```\n- Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis.\n\nactivity$date is converted from factor to date class. I used the \"zoo\" package to manage the time serie which, furthermore, is regularly spaced.\n\n``` {r}\n\nactivity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\nlibrary(zoo)\nis.regular(activity$date)\nactivity$zoo_date <- with(activity, zoo(steps, date)) \n```\n\n\n## 2. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?\n\n- Calculate the total number of steps taken per day\n```{r}\nsteps_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = sum)\nsteps_day\n```\nThe result is stored in the variable \"steps_day\"\n\n- Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\n\nApproximately the 13% of cases in \"steps\" result in missing data.\n\n```{r}\n\nhist(steps_day$steps)\n\n```\n\n- Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day\n\n```{r}\naggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = mean)\naggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = median)\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
