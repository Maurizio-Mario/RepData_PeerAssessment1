## 1. Loading and preprocessing the data

Unzip and read the data  from the GitHub repository. Dimensional exploration.

```{r}
activity <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
View(activity)
dim(activity)
```
## 2. Mean total number of steps taken per day

The data from this csv will be transformed, a mean and median calculated and a histogram displayed.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
